# MariaDB Columnstore Vagrant

A Vagrant installation with simple provisioning of MariaDB Columnstore, maintained by Vettabase.

## Requirements

This Vagrantfile is tested with these providers:
  * [libvirt](https://vagrant-libvirt.github.io/vagrant-libvirt/)
  * [VirtualBox](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/providers/virtualbox)

To install the libvirt plugin:

    sudo apt install qemu-kvm
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt

## Usage

### Single Node Setup

Install and start the server:

    vagrant up

To use a non-default provider:

    vagrant up --provider=virtualbox

Optionally load some sample data:

    vagrant ssh -c /vagrant/sample/load.sh

### Using a MariaDB ColumnStore VM

To log into the system:

    vagrant ssh

To connect to MariaDB:

    vagrant ssh -c mariadb

To run a query non-interactively:

    vagrant ssh -c mariadb -e "SELECT VERSION();"

### Operations

To operate the MariaDB service, use the regular [systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/)
commands.

To update the timezone system tables:

    vagrant ssh
    /vagrant/utils/timezones-load.sh

This will restart MariaDB. To avoid a restart, set `SKIP_RESTART=1`.

## TODO

* Multi-node setup
* Include an S3 target like Minio
